# Venequia

## The Game

Venequia is a text-based role-playing game inspired by stories from the real game ‘Tibia’, which is a fantasy game where you fight against various creatures in order to develop your character and do good.

## Development

The game has been developed by using Python as the programming language, OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and Modularization.

## Purpose

As a student of a Python short course, I have been asked to do a small project where I can apply different programming algorithms to something I am passionate about, in this case ‘Games’.

## Development

The game was finished in its second chapter, due to time constraints, but with the possibility to expand the game by creating new stories, characters, enemies, attack forms, etc.

If you are reading this, you are free to contact me if you wish to collaborate in this project. I know it's a bit silly, but there's nothing better than enjoying doing two things you like, programming and games.
